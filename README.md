# Overview
KJ Games is aiming to be a simple games website
Consisting of a game per page and being easily expandable

Target Audience:
- People with some free time looking to occupy themselves
- Children with limited access to the internet being allowed to play simple games
- People bored at work / school looking for something to do

# User Experience [UX]

### Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time visitor I want to be able to easily understand the functionality of the website
- As a first time visitor I want to be able to immediately understand how to navigate and use the features of the website.
- As a first time visitor I expect the website to display appropriately on all the types of screen I view it on
- As a first time visitor I want to easily be able understand how to use the main features of the website

### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to play the same games again consistently without any bugs
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to suggest new ideas for games to be implemented.

### Colour Scheme

In order to keep each game consistent and simplistic but also professional and eyecatching. I opted for a neutral green and white contrast for the background and navbar.

The primary colours are `1BB295`, `#FFFFFF` and `#000000`

### Bug Fixes

Bug 001 - NavBar Hamburger was overlaying onto main content 
Bug Fix 001 - Used a Z-index of greater than 1 to force NavBar above main content
